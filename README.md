1. n = 5
sum = 15

2. You could detect an overflow by checking too see if the number has switched to a negative number. n = 256 produces and overflow.The largest summation is 32640.

3. The upper limit is 2147450880 and n = 65536 causes the overflow. 

4. You can detect overflow by testing if the number has switched to below 0. Overflow at n = 17. Largest factorial before everflow was 2004189184

5. overflows at  n = 170

6. Expected value is the n you put in. When you use a float it does not work and returns a value higher then the given n. When using a double it works as expected.

7. 4.4 is shown when it shouldn't be. This is because when working with floats the computer will cut off some of the binary off of the number causing a small degree of error and make the computer believe that it has not yet hit 4.4.

8. When using a double the intended output is displayed. Because a double can hold more information and is thus more reliable for bigger numbers of more complex math
