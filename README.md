# Lab03

1. ((Lab03.cpp))

2. You could detect an overflow by checking too see if the number has switched to a negative number. n = 256 produces and overflow.The largest summation is 32640.

3. The upper limit is 2147450880 and n = 65536 causes the overflow. 

4. You can detect overflow by testing if the number has switched to below 0. Overflow at n = 17. Largest factorial before everflow was 2004189184

5. overflows at  n = 170

6. That it will aproach a whole number but never actually hit it. It will start to approach the number as expected but it will overflow and jump to the whole number.
